# Vault

## Challenge

The Vault.sol is deployed with the contract owning 1 ETH of the shares.

Your mission is to capture the flag by emptying the vault, then calling captureTheFlag with an address you control to prove that you have succeeded in completing the challenge, so that vault.flagHolder returns your address.
