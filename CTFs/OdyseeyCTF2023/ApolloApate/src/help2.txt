Story:

Apate, does not want you to know the truth.
She wants to keep the truth for herself, however
she left something behind, a list of words that lead to the truth.
What lies behind 0xe2c8f...

Function:
seekFlag(string) -> Give the correct string, then the flag will be yours.

Goals:

You are provided with wordlist.txt, one of them has the same value with what Apate left behind,
Of course, it's not the full hash value, but you need to find one word that has the same value with 0xe2c8f.
