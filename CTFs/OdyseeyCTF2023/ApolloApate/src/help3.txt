Story:

Apollo and Apate finally met, listen to what they have to say to each other.
They might've left some clue for us. I know for sure, Apollo lead us here.
Apate teach us how to find the truth in the sea of lies.
Guess, History will be changed once again.

Functions:

finalTruth(str1,str2,str3,str4,str5) -> Listen to what Apollo and Apate have to say. Unlock the final Truth!
   > str1 -> input the value of flag 1.
   > str2 -> input the value of flag 2.
   > str3 -> From the conversation what's the first key they mentioned.
   > str4 -> From the conversation what's the second key they mentioned.
   > str5 -> From the conversation what's the Last key they mentioned.


trace() -> It'll give you a little bit of hint if you lost.

Goal:

Unveil the last truth, search the 3 keys that you need, the conversation is recorded!
